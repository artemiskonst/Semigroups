    <Heading>For those in a hurry</Heading>
    In this section we give a brief description of how to start using
    &SEMIGROUPS;.<P/>

    It is assumed that you have a working copy of &GAP; with version number
    &GAPVERS; or higher. The most up-to-date version of &GAP; and instructions
    on how to install it can be obtained from the main &GAP; webpage
    <URL>https://www.gap-system.org</URL>.<P/>

    The following is a summary of the steps that should lead to a
    successful installation of &SEMIGROUPS;:

    <List>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &IO; package version &IOVERS; or higher is available.
        &IO; must be compiled before &SEMIGROUPS; can be loaded.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &ORB; package version &ORBVERS; or higher is available.
        &ORB; and &SEMIGROUPS; both perform better if &ORB; is compiled.
      </Item>
      
      <Item>
        ensure that the &DATASTRUCTURES; package version &DATASTRUCTURESVERS;
        or higher is available.  &DATASTRUCTURES; must be compiled before
          &SEMIGROUPS; can be loaded.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &DIGRAPHS; package version &DIGRAPHSVERS; or higher is
        available.  &DIGRAPHS; must be compiled before &SEMIGROUPS; can be
        loaded.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        ensure that the &GENSS; package version &GENSSVERS; or higher is
        available.
      </Item>
      
      <Item>
        ensure that the &IMAGES; package version &IMAGESVERS; or higher is
        available.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        download the package archive <F>&ARCHIVENAME;.tar.gz</F> from
        <URL Text = "the Semigroups package webpage">https://semigroups.github.io/Semigroups</URL>.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        unzip and untar the file, this should create a directory called
        <F>&ARCHIVENAME;</F>.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        locate the <F>pkg</F> directory of your &GAP; directory, which contains
        the directories <F>lib</F>, <F>doc</F> and so on. Move the directory
        <F>&ARCHIVENAME;</F> into the <F>pkg</F> directory.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        from version 3.0.0, it is necessary to compile the &SEMIGROUPS; package.
        &SEMIGROUPS; uses the 
        <URL Text =
          "libsemigroups">https://libsemigroups.github.io/libsemigroups/</URL>
        C++ library, which requires a compiler
        implementing the C++11 standard. 
        Inside the <F>pkg/&ARCHIVENAME;</F> directory, type
        <Listing>
<![CDATA[./configure
make]]></Listing>
        Further information about this step can be found in Section
        <Ref Sect = "Compiling the kernel module"/>.
      </Item>

      <Item>
        start &GAP; in the usual way (i.e. type <C>gap</C> at the command line).
      </Item>

      <Item>
        type <C>LoadPackage("semigroups");</C>
      </Item>
    </List>

    <E><B>Please note that</B> from version 3.0.0: &SEMIGROUPS; can only be
      loaded if it has been compiled.</E><P/>

    If you want to check that the package is working correctly, you
    should run some of the tests described in Section
    <Ref Sect = "Testing your installation"/>.

    <!-- TODO: update this -->

    The &SEMIGROUPS; package is written in &GAP; and C++ and requires the
    &ORB;, &IO;, &DIGRAPHS;, &GENSS;, and &IMAGES; packages. The &ORB;
    package is used to efficiently compute components of actions, which
    underpin many of the features of &SEMIGROUPS;.  The &IO; package is used to
    read and write elements of a semigroup to a file.  The &DIGRAPHS; package
    is used in a variety of ways in the &SEMIGROUPS; package, in particular, to
    apply standard graph theoretic algorithms to certain data structures, and
    in certain cases for finding isomorphisms or automorphisms of digraphs.

    <Heading>Compiling the kernel module</Heading>
    As of version 3.0.0, the &SEMIGROUPS; package has a &GAP; kernel module
    written in C/C++ and this must be compiled.  The kernel module contains
    low-level functions relating to the enumeration of certain types of
    semigroups, and it is not possible to use the &SEMIGROUPS; package without
    compiling it.
    <P/>

    To compile the kernel component inside the <F>pkg/&ARCHIVENAME;</F>
    directory, type
<Listing>
<![CDATA[
./configure
make]]></Listing>
    <P/>

    If you are using GCC to compile &SEMIGROUPS;, then version 5.0 or higher is
    required. Trying to compile &SEMIGROUPS; with an earlier version of GCC
    will result in an error at compile time. &SEMIGROUPS; supports GCC version
    5.0 or higher, and clang version 5.0 or higher.<P/>

    If you installed the package in another <F>pkg</F> directory other than the
    standard <F>pkg</F> directory in your &GAP; installation, then you have to
    do two things. Firstly during compilation you have to use the option
    <C>--with-gaproot=PATH</C> of the <C>configure</C> script where <C>PATH</C>
    is a path to the main &GAP; root directory (if not given the default
    <C>../..</C> is assumed).<P/>

    If you installed &GAP; on several architectures, you must execute the
    configure/make step for each of the architectures. You can either do this
    immediately after configuring and compiling &GAP; itself on this
    architecture, or alternatively set the environment variable
    <C>CONFIGNAME</C> to the name of the configuration you used when compiling
    &GAP; before running <C>./configure</C>.  Note however that your compiler
    choice and flags (environment variables <C>CC</C> and <C>CFLAGS</C>) need
    to be chosen to match the setup of the original &GAP; compilation. For
    example you have to specify 32-bit or 64-bit mode correctly!

    <Heading>Rebuilding the documentation</Heading>

    The &SEMIGROUPS; package comes complete with pdf, html, and text versions
    of the documentation. However, you might find it necessary, at some point,
    to rebuild the documentation. To rebuild the documentation use the <Ref
      Func = "SemigroupsMakeDoc"/>.

  <Section Label = "Testing your installation">
    <Heading>Testing your installation</Heading>

    In this section we describe how to test that &SEMIGROUPS; is working as
    intended.  To quickly test that &SEMIGROUPS; is installed correctly use
    <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestInstall"/> - this will take a few seconds.
    For more extensive tests use <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestStandard"/> - this
    may take several minutes.  Finally, for lengthy benchmarking tests use
    <Ref Func = "SemigroupsTestExtreme"/> - this may take more than half an
    hour. <P/>

    If something goes wrong, then please review the instructions in Section
    <Ref Sect = "For those in a hurry"/> and ensure that &SEMIGROUPS; has been
    properly installed.  If you continue having problems, please use the 
    <URL Text =
